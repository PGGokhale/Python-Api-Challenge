# Python-Api-Challenge


## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

In this example,a Python script is created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

* This repository is to submit Python API homework.
    * It consists of a jupyter notebook
    * Four plots saved as .png
    * A csv file consisting of the weather report for the cities accross the globe.
    * A pdf report consisting of the python scripts, the output plots and the Observations based on the plots.
